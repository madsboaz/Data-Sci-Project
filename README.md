# Missing Persons Data Insights
For my project on missing persons cases, I examined how demographic features such as age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status influence trends in missing persons reports. Leveraging Python and machine learning libraries like Pandas, scikit-learn, and Seaborn, I cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and reliability. My approach involved building predictive models using algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to uncover patterns and correlations between demographic factors and the likelihood of being reported as missing.

Through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, I optimized the models for accuracy and interpretability. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn helped me present findings, including disparities in how certain demographics are represented in missing persons data. These insights highlight systemic issues, such as how minority and lower-income groups might experience delays in reporting or receive less media attention. My results aim to inform policy changes and improve practices around reporting, investigating, and supporting families affected by missing persons cases.
